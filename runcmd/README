This is a implementation of the POSIXeg (https://gitlab.com/monaco/posixeg) "libruncmd" exercise.

As specified in the exercise README:
	"make" will build the static and dynamic versions of the library in the current directory
	"make install PREFIX=<path>" will install the library in the specified path.
	"make uninstall PREFIX=<path>" undoes what make install does.
	"make dist" packs the library in a tarball (runcmd.tgz)

"make" will also build a simple test program named "test". It can be used to execute a command using the library: use "./test <command> <argument 1> <argument 2> ..." or "./test "<command> <argument 1> <argument 2> ..."". The program will display the information about the execution provided by the library on termination.
"test" is linked dynamically with libruncmd by default. In order to run it, you must do

LD_LIBRARY_PATH=.
export LD_LIBRARY_PATH

beforehand in your shell to allow the library to be found.

You can build the static version of "test" with "make test-static" and using "./test-static".

The library can be tested against POSIXeg's test-runcmd program by following the instructions under "HOW TO TEST YOUR IMPLEMENTATION" on the exercise's README file.
