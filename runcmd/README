This is a implementation of the POSIXeg (https://gitlab.com/monaco/posixeg) "libruncmd" exercise.

As specified in the exercise README:
	"make" will build the static and dynamic versions of the library in the current directory
	"make install PREFIX=<path>" will install the library in the specified path.
	"make uninstall PREFIX=<path>" undoes what make install does.
	"make dist" packs the library in a tarball (runcmd.tgz)

"make" will also build a simple test program named "test". It can be used to execute a command using the library: use "./test <command> <argument 1> <argument 2> ..." or "./test "<command> <argument 1> <argument 2> ..."". The program will display the information about the execution provided by the library on termination.
"test" is linked dynamically with libruncmd by default. You can build the static version with "make test-static".

The library can be tested against POSIXeg's test-runcmd program by following the instructions under "HOW TO TEST YOUR IMPLEMENTATION" on the exercise's README file.
