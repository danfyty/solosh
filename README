SoloSH is an implementation of two programming exercises contained in POSIXeg (https://gitlab.com/monaco/posixeg/).
The first one is libruncmd - a library to execute a command as a subprocess - specified here: https://gitlab.com/monaco/posixeg/blob/master/runcmd/exercise/runcmd.txt
The second one is "foosh" - a POSIX shell - specified here: https://gitlab.com/monaco/posixeg/blob/master/shell/foosh/foosh.txt

The implementations follow the specifications accurately, with only a few minor exceptions and particular details.
