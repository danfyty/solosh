Hello!

This is my implementation of the [POSIXeg](https://gitlab.com/monaco/posixeg) "runcmd" exercise and of a POSIX shell. 
They were made as an assignment for an Operating Systems class. Their specifications can be found [here](https://gitlab.com/monaco/posixeg/blob/master/runcmd/exercise/runcmd.txt) and [here](https://gitlab.com/monaco/posixeg/blob/master/shell/foosh/foosh.txt), respectively. This project follows (almost all of) them.
Other implementations may be found [here](https://github.com/SOII-2016).
